SQL Automarker
===

This project aimed to create a system to assign and automatically mark SQL database assignments. This
system was created to enhance the University of Cape Town’s Computer Science department’s assign-
ment marking. There already exists an automatic marker for code (Java, Python, etc.) yet assignments
that involve SQL are currently marked manually, which often takes up an unnecessary amount of time
and effort.
The purpose of this system is to reduce the need for manual marking of assignments – which are
prone to human errors, and to different marking styles of tutors (one might be extremely lenient while
another may be overly strict, despite there being a memorandum). Through its automation, the marking
process would be able happen in real time, provide feedback to the student as soon as s/he has completed
the assignment, and record marks in a manner that is easily accessible to the assessor.
Additionally, with this system, the department would have the option of running assignments as a
closed practical assessment or as a homework assignment. Unlike the current method, where the student
has vast amounts of time to complete their SQL assignment and is able to cheat or get copious amounts
of help, this automated version looks to reduce the ability of a student to cheat and to reflect their real
academic capabilities.
The system, by default, will have two pre-installed models for which the lecturer may choose to
examine from or alternate from year to year. If the assessor would like to use his/her own dataset, the
system has been set up in such a way that s/he would be able to import the datasets directly into MySQL
and have it reflect in the system’s interface. Furthermore, the decision was taken to create an online
MySQL server, hosted by Amazon’s Web Service in order to allow for easy access to the raw data and
information in order to easily add to/ remove from the necessary tables and databases.
